# ResNet

### just finished very basic framework for resnet

### todo:
* all resnet variants (bottleneck, basicblock, etc)
* make flexible framework
* rename files 
* document small differences in architecture (i.e pytorch downsizes images in conv3x3 while other networks downsize in first conv1x1)
* add upgrades (zero init, etc)
* clean up code and add better documentation instead of comments everywhere
