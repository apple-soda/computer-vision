# computer-vision (in progress)

## trying to provide a flexible framework that can utilize pretrained weights while being easy to modify/tune, and to learn all the architectures myself :)


### features to do:
* weight mapping function (so the self implemented networks arent restricted by the layer names)
* more flexibility when possible (same file for basic/bottleneck blocks)
* data aug/layer tuning/etc features
* train/setup utils
* timm/pytorch compatibility? 
* more architectures obviously
